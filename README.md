In this exercise, you will learn how to:

Create a Context

Use useContext to access data from the Context
Share state and functions between components without using props

Step 1: Creating a Context
  Create a new file called UserContext.js.
  Inside this file, create a UserContext and a UserProvider component that will hold the shared state.
  
Step 2: Using useContext in Components
  Create a new file called UserProfile.jsx.
  Inside this file, create a functional component called UserProfile. This component will access the user data from UserContext using the useContext hook.
  
Step 3: Updating Context Data
  Create a new file called UpdateUser.jsx.
  Inside this file, create a functional component called UpdateUser that allows the user to update their name.
